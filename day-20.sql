-- Title: Hot Cocoa Break Logs
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
  cl.log_id,
  cl.break_id,
  ct.cocoa_name,
  l.location_name
FROM cocoa_logs AS cl
JOIN cocoa_types AS ct ON ct.cocoa_id   = cl.cocoa_id
JOIN break_schedule AS bs ON bs.break_id   = cl.break_id
JOIN locations AS l  ON l.location_id = bs.location_id
ORDER BY cl.log_id;
